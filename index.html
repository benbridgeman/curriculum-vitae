                    <h2>PERSONAL PROFILE</h2>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            During my career as a Graphic Designer I have developed a strong aptitude for time management and creative problem-solving,
                            this enabled me to take on multiple responsibilities and deliver effective and efficient solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my previous role in Production for a publication house, I was the sole layout artist for two 60-70 page magazines
                            on a monthly cycle, I managed the content and functionality of the magazine websites via CMS,
                            designed html email campaigns for in-house and external utility and maintained and updated the
                            company aesthetics inbetween production cycles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My background in Graphic Design and Illustration is proving extremely helpful while I continue to improve my skills in Web-based technologies, 
                            it allows me to create content that is both easy to use and easy to look at!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In video games, I love anything to do with building, and when it comes to coding, building anything requires careful-planning,
                            structure, creativity, an eye for detail, problem-solving and good time management. These are
                            skills I have gained and developed throughout my career, and I am always looking to learn new
                            skills!

                        <p>
                            One of my passions is playing video games, it allows me to unwind, relax and often challenge myself. I mainly enjoy games
                            with a goal to work towards, for example I am currently playing Overwatch and trying to climb
                            the leaderboards as a 'support' or 'tank' role (these roles enable me to support and bolster
                            my team).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also enjoy baking whenever I can as I find it very therapeutic, there's nothing quite like the aroma and taste of home-baked
                            bread. I love experimenting with different recipes and adapting them to my taste, my current
                            favourite is a vegan chocolate sponge recipe that I improvised into a chocolate-orange cake with
                            dark chocolate-orange frosting (still vegan!).
